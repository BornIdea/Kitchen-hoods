Automatic fire alarm and detection systems
In some small, open-plan, single-storey offices and shops, a fire may be obvious to everyone as soon as it starts. In these cases, where the number and position of exits and the travel distance to them is adequate, a simple shout of ‘FIRE’ or a simple manually operated device, such as a gong or air horn that can be heard by everybody when operated from any single point within the building, may be all that is needed. Where a simple shout or manually operated device is not adequate, it is likely that an electrical fire warning system will be required.

Automatic fire detection
Automatic fire detection may be needed for a number of reasons. These can include:

if you have areas where people are isolated or remote and could become trapped by a fire because they are unaware of its development
if you have areas where a fire can develop unobserved (e.g. storerooms)
as a compensating feature, e.g. for inadequate structural fire protection, in dead-ends or where there are extended travel distances; and
where smoke control and ventilation systems are controlled by the automatic fire detection system.
If you have an automatic fire detection system, the system should:

be designed to accommodate the emergency evacuation procedure;
give an automatic indication of the fire warning and its location. If the indicator panel is located in a part of the premises other than the control point (for example, the secretary’s office) there should ideally be a repeater panel sited at the control point;
be maintained and tested by a competent person and;
communicate with a central control room, (if you have one).
